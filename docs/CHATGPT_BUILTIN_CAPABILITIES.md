# ChatGPT Built-in Capabilities for Notion API Actions

## Overview of Built-in Capabilities

ChatGPT offers 4 built-in capabilities that can be enabled for your GPT Actions:

1. **Web Search**
2. **Canvas** 
3. **Image Generation**
4. **Code Interpreter & Data Analysis**

---

## 🎯 Recommendations for Your Notion API

### ✅ **ENABLE: Code Interpreter & Data Analysis**

**Why:**
- **Data visualization** - Users can query Notion databases and visualize results (charts, graphs)
- **Batch operations** - Process CSV files to bulk-create records
- **Data transformation** - Clean/format data before inserting into Notion
- **Analysis** - Analyze query results, find patterns, generate insights
- **Export/Import** - Convert between Notion format and other formats (CSV, JSON)

**Real-world use cases:**
```
User: "Query all my sales records and show me a revenue trend chart"
→ notionQuery retrieves data
→ Code Interpreter creates visualization

User: "Import this CSV of 100 contacts into my CRM database"
→ Code Interpreter parses CSV
→ Batch creates records via notionWrite

User: "Analyze my project completion rates by team member"
→ notionQuery gets project data
→ Code Interpreter analyzes and reports
```

**Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**

---

### ⚠️ **MAYBE: Web Search**

**Pros:**
- Can look up Notion API documentation during conversations
- Help users find database IDs from public Notion pages
- Research best practices for database schema design
- Look up property type specifications

**Cons:**
- Not directly related to core API operations
- May distract from your API's capabilities
- Could lead to confusion (searching web vs searching Notion)

**Use if:**
- You want GPT to provide Notion best practices beyond your API
- Users need help with Notion concepts (not just your API)
- Educational/tutorial GPT (not just operational)

**Skip if:**
- Pure API operations GPT
- You want focused interactions
- Users already know Notion

**Rating: ⭐⭐⭐ OPTIONAL - Depends on use case**

---

### ❌ **SKIP: Canvas**

**Why NOT relevant:**
- Canvas is for creating visual documents/presentations
- Your API is about data operations (CRUD)
- Not aligned with Notion database management
- Would confuse users about GPT's purpose

**Only enable if:**
- You want to create visual guides/tutorials about using the API
- Building onboarding flows with diagrams
- Not recommended for operational GPT

**Rating: ⭐ NOT RECOMMENDED**

---

### ❌ **SKIP: Image Generation**

**Why NOT relevant:**
- Your API doesn't handle Notion images
- Notion API file uploads are complex (separate from your middleware)
- Not part of core database operations
- Would mislead users about capabilities

**Only enable if:**
- Future feature: You add image upload to Notion
- Currently: No practical use case

**Rating: ⭐ NOT RECOMMENDED**

---

## 🎯 Recommended Configuration

### For Operational/Production GPT:
```
✅ Code Interpreter & Data Analysis - YES
❌ Web Search - NO
❌ Canvas - NO  
❌ Image Generation - NO
```

**Why:** Focused on data operations. Code Interpreter adds genuine value for analysis and batch operations.

---

### For Educational/Tutorial GPT:
```
✅ Code Interpreter & Data Analysis - YES
✅ Web Search - YES
❌ Canvas - NO
❌ Image Generation - NO
```

**Why:** Web Search helps answer Notion questions beyond your API. Canvas/Image still not relevant.

## 💡 How Code Interpreter Enhances Your API

### Use Case 1: Data Visualization
```
User: "Show me my project completion rate over time"

Flow:
1. notionQuery → Retrieve all projects with completion dates
2. Code Interpreter → Parse dates, calculate rates, create line chart
3. Return → Visual graph + insights
```

### Use Case 2: Bulk Import
```
User: "Here's a CSV with 500 products. Import to my inventory database"

Flow:
1. Code Interpreter → Parse CSV, validate data
2. Loop → notionWrite for each row (with rate limiting)
3. Return → Success report with any errors
```

### Use Case 3: Data Transformation
```
User: "Export my customer database to Excel format"

Flow:
1. notionQuery → Retrieve all customer records
2. Code Interpreter → Convert to Excel with proper formatting
3. Return → Downloadable .xlsx file
```

### Use Case 4: Analytics & Insights
```
User: "What's my average deal size by sales rep?"

Flow:
1. notionQuery → Get all deals with amounts and owners
2. Code Interpreter → Group by rep, calculate averages, find top performers
3. Return → Summary table + recommendations
```

### Use Case 5: Data Validation
```
User: "Check my database for duplicate emails"

Flow:
1. notionQuery → Get all records
2. Code Interpreter → Find duplicates, analyze patterns
3. Return → List of duplicates + cleanup suggestions
```

## 🚫 Why Skip Canvas & Image Generation?

### Canvas Issues:
- **Purpose mismatch** - Canvas creates documents, your API manages data
- **User confusion** - "Can this create Notion pages?" (Yes, but not visual docs)
- **Distraction** - Takes focus away from core database operations

### Image Generation Issues:
- **No API support** - Your middleware doesn't upload images to Notion
- **False expectations** - Users think they can add images to pages
- **Complexity** - Notion file uploads require separate implementation
- **Not CRUD** - Doesn't fit create/read/update/delete pattern

---

## 🔄 Web Search: Pros & Cons

### ✅ Enable Web Search If:

1. **Educational GPT** - Teach users Notion best practices
   ```
   User: "What's a good structure for a CRM database?"
   → Web Search: Research CRM best practices
   → Your API: Create database with recommended schema
   ```

2. **Discovery Mode** - Help find database IDs
   ```
   User: "Here's my Notion page URL, add a record"
   → Web Search: Extract database ID from URL
   → Your API: Create record
   ```

3. **Documentation Helper** - Look up Notion property types
   ```
   User: "What's the difference between select and status?"
   → Web Search: Find Notion docs
   → Explain difference
   ```

### ❌ Skip Web Search If:

1. **Pure Operations** - Users just want to execute commands
2. **Security Concerns** - Don't want GPT searching external sites
3. **Focused Scope** - Only your API, no external info
4. **Speed Priority** - Web Search adds latency
